# Geolocation
Get my location using geo location API

# Challenge Goals

- [x] Call this 'http://ip-api.com/json/' with AJAX, that URL returns information about your location.
- [x] Call the URL when the page loads
- [x] Show me an indicator when the request is happening
- [x] When the data comes, show me my location on the HTML

# Notes
- Because the URL is not on https, Codesandbox won't let you fetch, so make this example on your computer and then copy paste the code in Codesandbox to submit.
